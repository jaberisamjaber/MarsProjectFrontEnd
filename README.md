## Overview
For the front end, I used Angular to create and process the necessary API calls made to NASAs api. 

# Instillation and Process to run
* Download Node and a Visual Studio Code
* Install angular using node
* Clone the Repository
* Import your code into the IDE
* Run the code using `ng serve` and then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Functionality
* Calls the backend to fetch the images through a single endpoint
* enter data into the two input fields and hit find photos
* makes sure inputs are valid before allowing user to submit
